Policy Registration Factory
===========================

A JNDI ObjectFactory for a PolicyRegistration. This is a work around for [SECURITY-864](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/SECURITY-864).

This used deprecated API that is likely going away with [Elytron](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY/WildFly+Elytron+Security).
